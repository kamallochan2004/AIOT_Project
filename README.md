# Ensuring Real-Time Safety with Raspberry Pi and Machine Learning

This project implements a system for real-time safety monitoring in public areas using a Raspberry Pi and machine learning techniques. It combines face mask detection and non-contact temperature measurement to help prevent the spread of illness.

## Features

Face mask detection with machine learning model for mask compliance monitoring.
Non-contact temperature measurement using an infrared sensor.
Real-time feedback system to indicate mask compliance and temperature readings.
(Optional: Add any additional features your project offers)
## Getting Started

This project requires a Raspberry Pi, a camera module, a non-contact temperature sensor, and software libraries for machine learning and sensor interaction.

Prerequisites:

Raspberry Pi (any model with sufficient processing power)
Raspberry Pi Camera Module
Non-contact temperature sensor (MLX90614 or similar)
Python 3 with libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow, NumPy (pre-installation recommended)
