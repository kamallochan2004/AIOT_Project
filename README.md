# Ensuring Real-Time Safety with Raspberry Pi and Machine Learning
This project implements a system for real-time safety monitoring in public areas using a Raspberry Pi and machine learning techniques. It combines face mask detection and non-contact temperature measurement to help prevent the spread of illness.

## Features

- Face mask detection with a machine learning model for mask compliance monitoring.  
- Non-contact temperature measurement using an infrared sensor.  
- Real-time feedback system to indicate mask compliance and temperature readings.  

## Getting Started
This project requires a Raspberry Pi, a camera module, a non-contact temperature sensor, and software libraries for machine learning and sensor interaction.

### Prerequisites:

- **Hardware:**
  - Raspberry Pi (any model with sufficient processing power)  
  - Raspberry Pi Camera Module  
  - Non-contact temperature sensor (MLX90614 or similar)  

- **Software:**
  - Python 3  
  - Libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow, NumPy (pre-installation recommended)
